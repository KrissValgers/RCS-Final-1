In this time I was working in three different style Hotels & four bars.

As well as welcoming & serving hotel and conference guests, making cocktails, being adaptive to every situation, and performing my best. This is one of the biggest conference hotels in the Baltics, so every evening we had high-level hotel meetings & banquets, such as NATO Summit, Government meetings, even Presidential Inauguration Summit, and Embassy meetings. So because of the high standards, most of the skills I learned in this Hotel as a young student.
